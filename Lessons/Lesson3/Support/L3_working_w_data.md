# Portfolio performance

## Expense ratio
So far we have looked at the absolute numbers. Now we will start looking more at the data from performance perspective.

Now from what you have learned so far, try to create expense ratio.

```{r}
your code

```

Now create loss ratio, combined ratio and underwriting result for each data record.

```{r}
your code

```

Which of the records has the best performance in terms of individual KPIs?

### Regional analysis
Usually we look at the data in some geographic perspective. Mainly because of the local regulations, laws and accounting.

Now we will have a look at the performance of our insurance company by regions.

Which region is performing the best when we look at the individual KPIs?

```{r}
your code

```

Many times we are interested to see how the business is doing in time. It is nice if the company is historically profitable but it is also important to see if we are currently profitable.

Let's see how the single regions perform in time. Create a chart that shows a particular KPI of a single region in time.

```{r}
your code

```

How would you describe what you see in the chart? What can it mean what you see in the chart?


### Unit analysis
Let's have a look at the analysis on a different level. Let's see how the units are performing. Prepare KPIs for each unit in every region (ie prepare expense ratio, loss ratio, combined ratio and underwriting result). Which unit performs the best?

```{r}
your code

```

Now prepare a chart that shows you how the separate units perform in time.

```{r}
your code

```

Looking at the overall unit performance, we can check how well did the units fulfilled their plans. Create a variable where you calculate to what extent a single unit achieved to meet its plan.

```{r}
your code

```

### Segment and business analysis

Over time, insurance companies are also interested in how the market looks like. We would like to know how specific segments (ie personal, small businesses, large businesses etc) perform.

Create KPIs for segments and analyze it in time. Do the same for business.
